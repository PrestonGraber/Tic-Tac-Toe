# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is an advanced tic-tac-toe game. Instead of using 3x3 it uses a 4x4 grid layout,which increases the amount of posibilities.
You can play normal mode, which makes the AI pick data-cells at random or you can play impossible mode. Impossible mode uses
the mini-max algorithim which will make very game end in a draw or result in the human-player losing. GoodLuck!
